			"Wow I don't know where to start but I can give you the following. My name is Abd al-Hadi Lababidi. I am a graduated software engineer. I have worked in several companies and gained a lot of experience and wonderful friends. I intend to meet more friends.In the beginning, programming for me was something new, through which I learned patience and dealing with the code as if it were a city of dreams. I could do anything with the code, build pyramids, build a car racing game, or even an integrated system to manage a lot of things. Beautiful and elaborate",
