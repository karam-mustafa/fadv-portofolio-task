						A declarative style, like what react has, allows you to
						control flow and state in your application by saying "It
						should look like this". An imperative style turns that
						around and allows you to control your application by
						saying "This is what you should do". The benefit of
						declarative is that you don't get bogged down in the
						implementation details of representing the state. You're
						delegating the organizational component of keeping your
						application views consistent so you just have to worry
						about state. Imagine you have a butler, who is kind of a
						metaphor for a framework. And you would like to make
						dinner. In an imperative world, you would tell them step
						by step how to make dinner. You have to provide these
						instructions: Go to the kitchen Open fridge Remove
						chicken from fridge ... Bring food to the table In a
						declarative world, you would simply describe what you
						want I want dinner with chicken. If your butler doesn't
						know how to make chicken, then you cannot operate in a
						declarative style. Just like if Backbone doesn't know
						how to mutate itself to do a certain task, you can't
						just tell it to do that task. React is able to be
						declarative because it "knows how to make chicken", for
						example. Compared to Backbone, which only knows how to
						interface with the kitchen. Being able to describe the
						state reduces the surface area for bugs dramatically,
						which is a benefit. On the other hand, you might have
						less flexibility in how things occur because you're
						delegating or abstracting away how you implement the
						state.
